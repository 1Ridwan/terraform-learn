Hi everyone! Welcome to my repository where I will be posting
all of my learning for the terraform module.

I will be learning how to create infrastructure as code and deploying small
apps through terraform and related tools.
# terraform-learn

This repo also contains my assignment, where I will deploy:

- Wordpress using terraform
- Configure a cloud init file and automate its deployment via EC2 in Terraform
